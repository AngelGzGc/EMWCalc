# EMW: Electro Magnetic Waves simulator.

### Summary

This project is an implementation of a FDTD algorithm to solve the Maxwell's equations in different scenarios.

In order to represent the results an ad-hoc implementation of a 3D plotter is coded. 

### Usage:

In order to compile and execute the program the two sub-programs shall be compiled and executed.

```
cd DataVisGL\Debug
make
cd ..\..\EMWCalc\Debug\
make
```

And then the DataVisGL shall be executed first (i.e: executing: ./DataVisGL in the Debug folder) and then the EMWCalc by the same process.


### Examples:

 * Wave reflected in a parabola after being generated in it's focus.
