# EMW: Electro Magnetic Waves simulator.

### Summary

This project is an implementation of a FDTD algorithm to solve the Maxwell's equations in different scenarios.

In order to represent the results an ad-hoc implementation of a 3D plotter is coded. 

### Examples:

 * Wave reflected in a parabola after being generated in it's focus.
